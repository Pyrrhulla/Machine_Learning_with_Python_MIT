**Project 1: Automatic Review Analyzer** 

The goal of this project is to design a classifier to use for sentiment analysis of product reviews. Our training set consists of reviews written by Amazon customers for various food products. The reviews, originally given on a 5 point scale, have been adjusted to a +1 or -1 scale, representing a positive or negative review, respectively. 


**Project 2: Digit Recognition** 

Aim: create a numeric recognition algorithm, using a simple neural network.  

The MNIST database contains binary images of handwritten digits commonly used to train image processing systems. The digits were collected from among Census Bureau employees and high school students. The database contains 60,000 training digits and 10,000 testing digits, all of which have been size-normalized and centered in a fixed-size image of 28 × 28 pixels. Many methods have been tested with this dataset.
